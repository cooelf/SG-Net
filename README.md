# SG-Net: Syntax-Guided Machine Reading Comprehension

 Codes for the AAAI 2020 paper **SG-Net: Syntax-Guided Machine Reading Comprehension**

**Update**:

*The text->dependency script to obtain the syntax mask: [convert_span.py](convert_span.py)*

*working in progress

![model](model.png)

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Instructions
You can run the model with the script *run_squad.sh* and *run_race.sh*.

We upload the processed example data in *data* folder which is annotated by our dependency labeler for quick practice. 

The labeler model is the [HPSG-Neural-Parser](https://github.com/DoodleJZ/HPSG-Neural-Parser). The implementation for this work will be publicly available soon.
